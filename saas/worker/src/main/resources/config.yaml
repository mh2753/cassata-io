# The worker will spawn numWorkerThreads threads. Each of these threds
# will poll the DB for pending events that are due for expiry. The 
# polling interval can be set with workerThreadPollingIntervalInMillis. 
# During each poll, a thread will lock numEventsProcessedPerTransaction 
# events. 
# Each of these events will then be relayed to its destination. In case 
# of HTTP failures, each event will be retried httpRetryCount times with 
# an exponential backoff
